sir, i have some doubt that is in the last video in that index.ejs you wrote this type of thing <% %> i know they are used to do some work but in that if else you wrote it many time and start end at diffrent part i didnt understand that where to close where to open it  while writing logical things. please explain it. that much and thank you for this amazing knowladge i'm just 15 and i already finished frontend then i was thinking backend will be hard but i found you and you rly teach in such a great way. i will try my best to tell about you to my friends and others
